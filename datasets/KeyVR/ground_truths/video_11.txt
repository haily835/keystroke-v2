jennifer, thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. sorry i had to leave but i had to meet with beth pearlman. i believe there was a lot of good information exchanged and that is why we ran so late. i certainly came away with a different insight to enron that i did not have before we met. regarding the relationship between compaq and enron, i need to make some things are very clear in our go forward strategy. at the end of the day, the account team, dave spurlin up through jeff, myself, and jerry, own the responsibility for the enron relationship. if corporate folks are making deals with enron, we still have to manage the account. peter blackmore is very clear about that. he was always preserved the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer. that is why we need to keep dave focused and knowing what transactions are taking place withing enron. he is not the decision maker or deals like the ebs one, but as you are well aware of, the ebs contract has impaired other business opportunities within enron. daves role responsibility is enron and making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the relationship with enron. i need your help with all enron organizations to around him, situations like ebs will continue. he has to ahve the total picture of business transactions happening at enron. he will understand how those situations can impact the business at and for enron.
