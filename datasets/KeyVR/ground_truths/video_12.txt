secondly, attached is the information that i recived regarding contracts with enron. regarding the power gas contact it is a five year deal with the sixth year being optional. the anual outlay is estimated to be sixteen million per year. i did make an error in using the ninety million divided five years versus six years. so at five years the value is eighty million. if you have something different, let us make sure that we are on the same page. i have attached the emails that i received this data from. regarding the ebs deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level set very quickly. compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive light. compaq will honor its commitments but we need to make sure that enron does the same. the botton line is there needs to be a resetting of booked. our expectations were ninety million a year based on the forecast provided by ebs, certainly not fourteen million, based on what we agreed to yesterday. i find it very difficult in the spirit of partnership to here that we are begin held accountable for our portion of the deal, when we dont have the revenue to off set it. based on what i have heard, both parties had shortcommings based on expectations that were set. i will speak to keith and rob this morning to see how it was left. i also need to get your perspective on the transaction. jenifer, if there is a business opportunity compaq certainly wants to continue in pursueing that with enron. provided its equitable for both sides. i realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get through it. jenifer, once again i appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and hosting compaq. i will contact you later today. thanks
