john, i left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow up with additional information for your review. we have three offerings currently available or coming soon that i feel i would compliment the small or mid cap and fixed income exposure you already have through redwood, sequoia, and willow. quantitative allocation, llc integrates four quantitative investment models to drive aggressive and potentially leveraged asset allocation decisions. generates  exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and futures transactions. portfolio market exposures can range from plus three hundred percent to minus a hundred percent of net assets. this is clearly different from the largely non leveraged stock picker funds you already own. i would consider this to be a predominately large cap investment. i think of it as an index fund with a brain and on steroids call me and i will explain that comment in more detail. juniper crossover fund, llc managed by orbimed advisors, and focused on global biotech and pharma. up to thirty percent participation in private equity. this could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world class manager. tamarack interanational fund, llc long short stock picker fund focused on the international mid cap market. i feel this fund is very similar in style to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the international markets that you currently lack. this is a new fund and the first closing will probably be in june. of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or soliciation of and offer to buy interests in these funds. please call me if you are interested in any of the strategies outlined above, and i will have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to you. thanks,
